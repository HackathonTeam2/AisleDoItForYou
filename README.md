# UGA Hackathon 7

## Challenge Attempted
### Eliminate the Friction (NCR)
>In the real world, we constantly deal with slow, inconvenient activities (waiting in lines to checkout, waiting to be sat at a restaurant, etc.) that interrupt the natural flow of our days. However, with the advent of modern technology, these annoying experiences are quickly disappearing (mobile banking, filing taxes, online shopping, online reservations for restaurants). Find a bad or cumbersome experience in a consumer’s daily activities (banking, retail, dining), and design a BETTER WAY to do that annoying task, or bypass it, or fix its issues… i.e. remove the friction.
